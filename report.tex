\begin{abstract}
The ability to search literature and collect and aggregate metrics around publications is a central tool for modern research. Both academic and industry researchers across hundreds of scientific disciplines, from astronomy to zoology, increasingly rely on search to understand what has been published and by whom.

The profile of an author with an ambiguous name tends to contain noise, resulting in papers that are incorrectly assigned to him or her. This KDD Cup task challenges participants to determine which papers in an author profile were truly written by a given author.

We adapted two methods to cope with these problems. We used a text analysis method to create topics. These topics are then treated as new features to classify paper-author combinations. An advanced graph database is used to create a graph from all authors. Examining the relations between authors will reveal useful information to profile a writer.

\subsection{Conclusion}

In this report, we presented two additional methods to extract more features from the KDD cup data. We are not satisfied with the results we have gotten. In hindsight, our approach to the graph-based model was ultimately too focused on making predictions based on a single property (weighted connection between paper authors and co-authors), which we believed to be ideal but proved to be hard to compute, and to not work well with the given data set in practice. 

The paper-topic model performed poorly due the noise in the text. Also, the 20 topics we chose were too few. In another attempt we should try to use a different number of topics. 

Our approach, to start with complex features, also gave us a lot of problems.
By the time we realized that the graph features we were hoping to extract were not as useful as we thought, we did not have enough time left to evaluate different features.

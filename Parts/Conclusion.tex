\subsection{Conclusion}

in this report, we presented two different methods to extract more features from the KDD cup data. We are not satisfied with the results we got. In hindsight, our graph approach to the problem was ultimately too focused on making predictions based on a single property (weighted connection between paper authors and co-authors), which we believed to be ideal but proved to be hard to compute, and to not work well with the given data set in practice. 

The paper-topic model performed poorly due the noise in the text. Also the 20 topics we choose were too few. In another attempt we should try to use a different number of topics. 

Our approach, to start with complex features, also gave us a lot of problems. By the time we realized that the graph features were not so important as we thought, we did not have enough time to look for different features.

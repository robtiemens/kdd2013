\section*{Introduction}

For the course Machine learning in practice we entered the KDD-Cup. This years KDD-Cup is about author-paper identification. In this paper we discuss our approach to win this competition. The methodology is illustrated using the data provided by the KDD-Cup. our method involves three different methods to find features in the given data set. We used  
a probabilistic author-topic model\cite{steyvers2004probabilistic} to extract topics from  the data, co-author graphs to get extra features from links between authors and we used some simple features provided by the data set. These features are used to train a random forest classifier.

The outline of the paper is as follows: in Section 2 we describe the background about author-topic model.

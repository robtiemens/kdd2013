\section{Introduction}

For the course ``Machine Learning in Practice'' we participated in the annual KDD-cup.
This year's KDD-Cup is about author-paper identification.
In this paper we present and discuss our approach to try to win this competition.
The methodology is illustrated using the data provided by the KDD-Cup.
Our approach involves three different methods to find features in the given data set.
We've used a probabilistic author-topic model~\cite{steyvers2004probabilistic} to extract topics from  the data, co-authorship graphs to get extra features from social connections between authors~\cite{liu2005co} and we have used the simple features available from the benchmark example project provided by the competition organisers.
These features are then used together to train a random forest classifier on the labeled data sets, which is then used to make predictions about the unlabeled data sets.

The outline of the paper is as follows: in Section~\ref{sec:background} we describe the scientific background of our methods, then describe our implementation details in Sections~\ref{sec:graph-implementation},~\ref{sec:text-implementation},~\ref{sec:smaller-features-implementation} and \ref{sec:classifier-implementation}. Finally, we present our results in Section~\ref{sec:results}.
